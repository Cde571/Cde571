# 👋 Hi, I'm @Cde571

👀 I’m interested in playing the guitar, immersing myself in the world of music, and exploring the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence.

🌱 I’m currently learning about web development, particularly focusing on creating engaging and functional websites. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for positive change, and I want to contribute to my community through my skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend my love for music with my passion for technology, creating platforms or applications that enhance the local artistic scene.
